  <description>Realize your most fervent desire to become the king of carrots in this wondrous biome!
  
  But beware! There are rivals to your throne! And those rivals are bunnies!
  They seek to steal YOUR carrots for themselves! What greed!
  Guard your carrot hoard jealously, or you shall surely lose it.
  
  You may meet a brave trader who specializes in the live capture and enslavement of bunnies.
  Give him your praise and your coin, and you shall prosper.
  
  Fleeing in no escape, as the bunnies will follow you into other biomes!
  Even modded biomes are no escape, as the dread bunnies will spawn in these mods:

Advanced Biomes
Alpha Biomes
Biome Expansion: Redwood Forest
Biomes Islands
More Vanilla Biomes
Realistic Planets</description>
